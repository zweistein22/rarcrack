# Rarcrack 

implemented unrar inside executable RarCrack.exe 
cmake and vcpkg based, win and linux.

linux build has some race conditions in threading gives false passwords , better use --threads 1
Windows build works properly (tested with 16 vCPU)

My comments:

linux install scripts .sh   are unfinished
